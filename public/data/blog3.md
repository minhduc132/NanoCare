  Caring for children's noses requires care and the use of age-appropriate products. Children have smaller and more sensitive nasal cavities than adults.

  ## Notes When Caring for Children's Noses

  ### Choose Appropriate Products
  Use products specifically designed for children, with appropriate size and pressure.

  ### Perform Gently
  When rinsing a child's nose, do it gently to avoid damaging the nasal mucosa.

  ### Monitor Reactions
  Observe the child's reactions and stop if the child feels uncomfortable.
